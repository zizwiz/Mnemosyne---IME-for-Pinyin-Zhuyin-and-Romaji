This app was written because I wanted to take previous code I had written for an embedded system and show others that making different IME is not difficult. Inside the code you will find tables that hold all the data. 

# Pinyin
Pinyin, or Hànyǔ Pīnyīn, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters.

The Hanyu Pinyin system was developed in the 1950s based on earlier forms of romanization of Chinese. It was published by the Chinese government in 1958 and revised several times.[1] The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted pinyin as an international standard in 1982.[2] The system was adopted as the official standard in Taiwan in 2009, where it is used for romanization alone (in part to make areas more English-friendly) rather than for educational and computer-input purposes.[3][4]

Pinyin has 4 tonal tones  

# Zhuyin
Zhuyin fuhao, Zhuyin or Bopomofo (pinyin: bōpōmōfō, Mandarin IPA: [pu̯ópʰu̯ómu̯ófu̯ó]) is a system of phonetic notation for the transcription of spoken Chinese, particularly the Mandarin dialect. The first two are traditional terms, whereas Bopomofo is the colloquial term, also used by the ISO and Unicode. Consisting of 37 characters and four tone marks, it transcribes all possible sounds in Mandarin. Zhuyin was introduced in China by the Republican Government in the 1910s and used alongside the Wade-Giles system, which used a modified Latin alphabet. The Wade system was replaced by Hanyu Pinyin in 1958 by the Government of the People's Republic of China,[1] and at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1982.[2] Although Taiwan officially abandoned Wade-Giles in 2009, Bopomofo is still the official phonetic notation system of the country and remains widely used as an educational tool and electronic input method in Taiwan. Zhuyin has four tones \u02C7, \u02CB, \u02CA, \u02D9

# Romanji
Japanese input methods are the methods used to input Japanese characters on a computer.

There are two main methods of inputting Japanese on computers. One is via a romanized version of Japanese called rōmaji (literally "Roman letters"), and the other is via keyboard keys corresponding to the Japanese kana. Some systems may also work via a graphical user interface, or GUI, where the characters are chosen by clicking on buttons or image maps. The romanization of Japanese is the application of the Latin script to write the Japanese language.[1] This method of writing is sometimes referred to in English as rōmaji (ローマ字?, literally, "roman letters") (Japanese pronunciation: [ɽóːmadʑi] About this sound listen (help·info)), sometimes incorrectly transliterated with an n as rōmanji. There are several different romanization systems. The three main ones are Hepburn romanization, Kunrei-shiki romanization (ISO 3602), and Nihon-shiki romanization (ISO 3602 Strict). Variants of the Hepburn system are the most widely used.
